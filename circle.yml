    # circle installs a ~/.git/config that forces access to github to go through ssh, rather than https, so that
    # circle's ssh deploy keys will work.  But this prevents access to github for cargo to download the cargo
    # registry.  This command should revert that configuration.

# Made an early attempt to cache ~/.cargo, ~/.rustup, and 'target'... but 'cargo build' would still recompile all the
# dependencies.  Since each of those dirs is 200MB and a 600MB pointless cache doesn't seem very nice to circle, and
# starting from scratch seems fast enough, I've reverted to that approach.
